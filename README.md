A pragmatic, full stack software developer with a passion for writing well designed and properly structured code, with over 9 years of industry experience.

Experienced using both front-end and back-end technology stacks, I enjoy developing creative solutions to complex problems. I have a strong understanding of software architecture and design patterns, allowing me to strategically plan my work and consider which approach provides the most optimal solution.

Hands-on experience in different Microsoft Technologies such as .NET Framework, C#.NET, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ADO.NET, LINQ, Entity Framework, Web Services, WCF, WebAPI, IIS, Azure & SQL Server, as well as front-end frameworks such as React JS and React Native. I also have experience using DevOps tools for effective source control, feature planning and software release cycles (CI/CID). 

I develop software with Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology. I learned to pair/mob programming which makes developers and testers to work together to create a successful product and will give best results in a self-organised agile team.

I am a strong advocate of SOLID Principles, Clean Code and TDD/BDD.
